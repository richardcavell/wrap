# Wrap by Richard Cavell (under development)
# Copyright (c) 2017 Richard John Foster Cavell
# Plan

== To do ==
Add info option
Add option for error on buffer underrun
Add license option
Get comments on my code
fail_msg() should print Error and \n automatically
Swap buffer and options in most function calls
Put all const things in options, non-const things in buffer
Eliminate that second function in main.c
Reorder struct options so that filenames go first
create_buffer() can allocate smaller buffer if malloc() fails
Put atexit() callbacks into their own source files
Implement wrapping algorithm
Move stdin filename check to file.c
Create more assertions in options.c
Move check_config to config.c
Call check_config from main()
Reorder the variable declarations in main()

== Considering ==
Change #defines to const ints
Rename config.h to something else
