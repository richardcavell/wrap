DONE 1. Most of the option parsing code should be moved to options.c
DONE 2. options_t is the kind of size where you should be passing around pointers, rather than always passing by value.
3. Consider using getopt to do the grunt work.
DONE 4. You re-declare open_file(const char *fn, struct options_t options); inside main.
DONE 5. Your default options invocation should be DEFAULT_INVOCATION and not NULL.
DONE 6. In options_t, the member 'int files' is far too non-descriptive.
DONE 7. You have a buffer size in options_t, but no buffer pointer (though you do allocate a buffer in open_file()
DONE 8. if ( buffer ) guarding free(buffer) is a waste, since free(NULL) is a safe operation to begin with.
DONE 9. Operand reversal is so 1980's - EOF == fclose(fp). See Question 17.4
DONE 10. Failing to open/close a file should not normally cause a program to exit.
DONE 11. Change #define of chars to const chars
DONE 12. Change **argv != hyphen to is_option()
DONE 13. Update the date of source code files
WONTDO 14. Change #defines to const ints
DONE 15. Remove actual_arg from parameter lists
DONE 16. Add -Wextra to CPPFLAGS
DONE 17. Create buffer info struct, file info struct
DONE 18. Rename struct _t (reserved name)
19. Make help text so that all options are on the same line
20. Convert Makefile so that it uses pattern rules
21. Add const where possible.
22. Check the result of printf()
