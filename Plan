# wrap by Richard Cavell v1.0
# January-February 2017
# Plan

== To do ==
Convert help text to short & little
Get comments on my makefile
Get comments on my script
Get comments on my code

== Considering ==
Consider using getopt to do the grunt work
Change #defines to const ints
Make help text so that all options are on the same line
Rename config.h to something else
Find a type that is more suitable for bufpos/endpos in buffer.h

== Done ==
Most of the option parsing code should be moved to options.c
options_t is the kind of size where you should be passing around pointers, rather than always passing by value.
You re-declare open_file(const char *fn, struct options_t options); inside main.
Your default options invocation should be DEFAULT_INVOCATION and not NULL.
In options_t, the member 'int files' is far too non-descriptive.
You have a buffer size in options_t, but no buffer pointer (though you do allocate a buffer in open_file()
if ( buffer ) guarding free(buffer) is a waste, since free(NULL) is a safe operation to begin with.
Operand reversal is so 1980's - EOF == fclose(fp). See Question 17.4
Failing to open/close a file should not normally cause a program to exit.
Change #define of chars to const chars
Change **argv != hyphen to is_option()
Update the date of source code files
Remove actual_arg from parameter lists
Add -Wextra to CPPFLAGS
Create buffer info struct, file info struct
Rename struct _t (reserved name)
Convert Makefile so that it uses pattern rules
Check the result of printf()
Rename VOID_TEXT
Add const where possible
