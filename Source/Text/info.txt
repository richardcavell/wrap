A word-wrapping program.

This program handles all characters that are
mentioned in "The C Programming Language" by Kernighan
and Ritchie (2nd edition), including backspace,
tab, vertical tab, carriage return, and unprintable
characters.  It also handles extremely long lines.
It will only work with "narrow" characters, and
assumes that your output text is monospaced.
