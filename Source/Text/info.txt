A word-wrapping program written by Richard Cavell.

This program handles all characters that are
mentioned in K&R 2nd edition, including backspace,
tab, vertical tab, carriage return, and unprintable
characters.  It also handles extremely long lines.
It will only work with "narrow" characters, and
assumes that your output text is monospaced.
